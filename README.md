# WebSocket Director

Command line tool for testing websocket servers using scenarios.

Suitable for testing any websocket server implementation, like [Action Cable](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actioncable), [Websocket Eventmachine Server](https://github.com/imanel/websocket-eventmachine-server), [Litecable](https://github.com/palkan/litecable) and so on.

## Installation

```bash
  $ gem install wsdirector-cli
```

## Usage

Create YAML file with simple testing script:

```yml
  # script.yml
  - receive: "Welcome" # expect to receive message
  - send:
      data: "send message" # send message, all messages in data will be parse to json
  - receive:
      data: "receive message" # expect to receive json message
```

and run it with this command:

```bash
wsdirector script.yml ws://websocket.server:9876/ws

#=> 1 clients, 0 failures
```

You can create more complex scenarios with multiple client groups:

```yml
  # script.yml
  - client: # first clients group
      name: "publisher" # optional group name
      multiplier: ":scale" # :scale take number from -s param, and run :scale number of clients in this group
      actions: # 
        - receive:
            data: "Welcome"
        - wait_all # makes all clients in all groups wait untill every client get this point (global barrier)
        - send:
            data: "test message"
  - client:
      name: "listeners"
      multiplier: ":scale * 2"
      actions:
        - receive:
            data: "Welcome"
        - wait_all
        - receive:
            multiplier: ":scale" # you can use multiplier with any action
            data: "test message"
```

Run with scale factor:


```bash
wsdirector script.yml ws://websocket.server:9876 -s 10

#=> Group publisher: 10 clients, 0 failures
#=> Group listeners: 20 clients, 0 failures
```

The simpliest scenario is just checking that socket is succesfully connected:

```yml
- client:
    name: connection check
  # no actions
```

### Protocols

WSDirector uses protocols to handle different actions.
Currently, we support "base" protocol (with `send`, `receive`, `wait_all` actions) and "action_cable" protocol, which extends "base" with `subscribe` and `perform` actions.

#### ActionCable Example

Channel code:

```ruby
class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from "chat_test"
  end

  def echo(data)
    transmit data
  end

  def broadcast(data)
    ActionCable.server.broadcast "chat_test", data
  end
end
```

Scenario:

```yml
- client:
    multiplier: ":scale"
    name: "publisher"
    protocol: "action_cable"
    actions:
      - subscribe:
          channel: "ChatChannel"
      - wait_all
      - perform:
          channel: "ChatChannel"
          action: "broadcast"
          data:
            text: "hello"
- client:
    name: "listener"
    protocol: "action_cable"
    actions:
      - subscribe:
          channel: "ChatChannel"
      - wait_all
      - receive:
          channel: "ChatChannel"
          data:
            text: "hello"
```

## Future Ideas

- File-less scenarios (JSON-encoded?), e.g.

```shell
wsdirector -i '{"receive": "hello"}' localhost:9898/ws
```

- Connection parameters (headers, query params, etc)

- Testing frameworks integrations

- Loading protocols dynamically
